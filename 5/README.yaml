  - title: Creating simple cluster
    description: >-
      In the following guide you will learn how to create simple two-node Elasticsearch cluster. This is only an example how to configure and link together containers, not a production ready configuration. For production ready configuration please refer to official documentation.
    runtimes: [DOCKER]
    instructions:
    - description: |-
        We will need a master node, that will also serve as a gateway to our cluster. Single slave node will be attached to the master node.

        Use the following content for the `docker-compose.yml` file, then run `docker-compose up`.

        ```yaml
        version: '2'
        services:
          elasticsearch-master:
            container_name: some-elasticsearch-master
            image: launcher.gcr.io/google/elasticsearch5
            ports:
              - '9200:9200'
            command:
              - '-Enetwork.host=0.0.0.0'
              - '-Etransport.tcp.port=9300'
              - '-Ehttp.port=9200'
          elasticsearch-slave:
            container_name: some-elasticsearch-slave
            image: launcher.gcr.io/google/elasticsearch5
            command:
              - '-Enetwork.host=0.0.0.0'
              - '-Etransport.tcp.port=9300'
              - '-Ehttp.port=9200'
              - '-Ediscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts=some-elasticsearch-master'
            depends_on:
              - elasticsearch-master
        ```

        Or you can use `docker run` directly:

        ```shell
        # elasticsearch-master
        docker run \
          --name some-elasticsearch-master \
          -p 9200:9200 \
          -d \
          launcher.gcr.io/google/elasticsearch5 \
          -Enetwork.host=0.0.0.0 \
          -Etransport.tcp.port=9300 \
          -Ehttp.port=9200

        # elasticsearch-slave
        docker run \
          --name some-elasticsearch-slave \
          --link some-elasticsearch-master \
          -d \
          launcher.gcr.io/google/elasticsearch5 \
          -Enetwork.host=0.0.0.0 \
          -Etransport.tcp.port=9300 \
          -Ehttp.port=9200 \
          -Ediscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts=some-elasticsearch-master
        ```

        After few seconds, we can check that cluster is running invoking `http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health`.
